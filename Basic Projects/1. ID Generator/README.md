# ID Generator

Create a Python program that generates a unique ID based on user input. The ID should be a combination of the user's first name, last name, birth year, and a random number.

## Requirements:

### User Input:

- Prompt the user to enter their first name.
- Prompt the user to enter their last name.
- Prompt the user to enter the year they were born.

### ID Components:

- Extract the first two letters of the first name and convert them to uppercase.
- Extract the first two letters of the last name and convert them to uppercase.
- Extract the last two digits of the birth year.
- Generate a random four-digit number.


### Output:

Display the generated unique ID to the user.

Example:
If the user inputs:

- First Name: John
- Last Name: Doe
- Birth Year: 1990
The program should generate an ID in the format: JOHNDO90XXXX, where XXXX is a random four-digit number.
